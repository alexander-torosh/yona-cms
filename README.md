## Installation

### Via Composer Create-Project

Run this in your terminal to get the latest Composer version:

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then run

```bash
php composer.phar create-project oleksandr-torosh/yona-cms -s dev
```

If you have already installed composer

```bash
composer create-project oleksandr-torosh/yona-cms -s dev
```

```json
{  
    "require": {  
        "oleksandr-torosh/yona-cms": "dev-master"  
    }  
}
```

```bash
php composer.phar install
